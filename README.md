# AI-Dynamix

![Live-Demo]([https://](https://aidynamix.pythonanywhere.com/))

AI-Dynamix is a Team project. This App is intended to be an All-in-one AI Code Assistant, which makes use of OpenAI API. The OpenAI API is a powerful tool that leverages state-of-the-art artificial intelligence to perform a wide array of tasks, including natural language processing, text generation, content classification, language translation, and more. This API harnesses advanced machine learning models to comprehend, generate, and manipulate text, enabling developers to create applications for tasks like content generation, question-answering systems, language understanding, and even creative writing..
Â 

## Description


-  This integrated system, empowered by the OpenAI API, amalgamates an AI-Powered Code Review Assistant, an Automated Documentation Generator, and an Automated Test Case Generator. This union serves as a comprehensive suite that significantly enhances software development processes. By employing the OpenAI API, it optimizes code review practices, streamlines documentation creation, and generates exhaustive test cases. Consequently, it elevates code quality, fosters collaboration among developers, and fortifies testing procedures, leading to more efficient and dependable software development.

-  In practical application, this system accelerates the development lifecycle, diminishes error rates, and substantially contributes to maintaining and scaling software projects effectively.

-  Additionally, to further support the developer community, the system offers a dedicated community forum tailored for various tech stacks. This forum serves as a hub for developers to discuss, seek advice, and share knowledge within their respective technological domains. Complementing this, there's a one-on-one real-time messaging platform enabling both group interactions and private conversations. This platform facilitates direct and instant communication among developers, fostering a collaborative environment for sharing insights, troubleshooting, and personal interactions.

- **Technology Used**: The technology stack comprises Python with Django for the backend, facilitating robust web development and logic handling. On the frontend, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the core structure, design, and interactivity of the system, while Bootstrap ensures a consistent and responsive layout.
- Crucially, the integration of the OpenAI API empowers advanced AI functionalities, enabling features like the Code Review Assistant, Automated Documentation Generator, and Test Case Generator.
Â 

**Client:** Javascript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

Â 

**Server:** Python language, Django, OpenAI API.

## How to Run Locally

Â Â In your Command line interface:

Â Â 

Â Â 1. Clone the repository to your local machine :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielzion/AI-Dynamix.git
```

Â Â 

Â Â 2. Enter into the directory : Â Â Â Â 

Â Â 

Â Â 3. Fetch for remote updates : Â Â Â Â Â 
Â Â 

Â Â 4. Pull any recent changes from the main branch: Â 
Â Â 

Â Â 5. Install a vrtual environment package :
    

Â Â 

Â Â 6. Create a virtual environment :
    python -m venv venv

Â Â 

Â Â 7. Activate the virtual environment :
    venv/Scripts/activate
    OR
    source venv/bin/activate

Â Â 

Â Â 8. Install dependencies : Â 
    pip install -r requirements.txt
Â 

Â Â 9. Make migrations: Â Â Â Â Â Â 
    python manage.py makemigrations
Â 

Â Â 10. Migrate all models : Â Â Â 
    python manage.py migrate
Â Â 

Â Â 11. Start Local Server: Â Â Â Â 
    python manage.py runserver
Â Â 

## How to Contribute

Â Â 1. Create a new branch to make your changes: `git checkout -b <your-branch-name>` Â and make the required changes.

Â Â 

Â Â 2. Stage the file: Â `git add <your-changed-file>`

Â Â 

Â Â 3. Commit your file: `git commit -m "<your-message>"`

Â Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Also, make sure your commit message is detailed with what you changed and where you changed it.

Â Â 

Â Â 4. Push your local changes: Â `git push origin <your-branch-name>` 

Â Â 

Â Â Â Â Â If an error occurs here, it means that someone has made changes to the original file while you were working.

Â Â Â Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Simply run : `git pull origin main` Â to sync your local file with the current main file and run `git push origin <your-branch-name>` again.

Â Â Â Â 

Â Â 5. Visit the remote url on Github to create a pull request.

Â Â 

Â Â 6. Wait for the team leader to accept your pull request.
